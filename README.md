# minesweeper
Generates and automatically solves the minesweeper game, no UI

--------This project is very old, the code is chaotic, it would need to be entirely reformatted------------

This project is one of the first ones I ever built, I built all the logic behind the famous Minesweeper game.
A basic AI based on hard coded logic rules solves the game automatically.
We also did stats on the capabilities of the various logic rules and the types of boards we can solve.

The main difficulty the AIs face is having to guess at the later stages of the board where corners are flagged and the situation is left to a completely random guess.
