# minesweeper

Generates and automatically solves the minesweeper game, no UI

requires numpy

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy
python minesweeper.py
```

This is the updated version of a very old code I wrote when I was 18, it generates and solves the minesweeper game through logic.

The program runs various grids and computes success statistics on it.
